This is the Final Project description for CptS360 as of Fall 2017

This Project is a simple EXT2 Shell Script that implements the following unix commands. This is the Level 1 set of implementation, below 
Level 2 or 3 which included more unix commands that could be implemented for extra credit. 
- ls: prints a list of all files in the current working directory 
- cd: changes the current working directory to the given path
- pwd: prints the pathname of the current working directory 
- mkdir: creates a new directory in the current working directory 
- creat: creates a new file in the current working directory 
- rmdir: removes an empty directory in the current working directory 
- link: creates a new file entry that links to the inode of another file
- symlink: creates a symbolic link from one file or directory to another 
- unlink: deallocates a given file and deletes its contents
- touch: updates the timestamp of a given file or directory 
- stat: prints in-depth stats of a given file
- chmod: changes the access permissions of a given file with a given octal permission setting

This code is intended to work on Unix architecture and must be compiled with a 32-bit compiler. 
It was written on a VM running Linux Mint and compiled with GCC. 
"kasperdisk" was the EXT2 virtual disk that was used for this Shell Script and maintains changes 
as the project is run.
